# Summary

In the landscape of modern Fortran programming, there exists a compelling need for neural network libraries tailored to the language. Given the extensive set of legacy codes built with Fortran, there is an ever-growing necessity to provide new libraries implementing on modern data science tools and methodologies. Fortran's inherent compatibility with high-performance computing resources, particularly CPUs, positions it as a language of choice for many machine learning problems.

The vast amount of computing capabilities available within current supercomputers worldwide would be an invaluable asset to the growing demand for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The `ATHENA` library is developed as a resource to bridge this gap; It provides a  robust suite of tools designed for building, training, and testing fully-connected and convolutional feed-forward neural networks. 

# Statement of need

`ATHENA` (Adaptive Training for High Efficiency Neural Network Applications) is a Fortran-based library aimed at providing users with the ability to build, train, and test feed-forward neural networks. The library leverages Fortran's strong support of array arithmatics, and its compatibility with parallel and high-performance computing resources. Additionally, there exist many improvements made available since Fortran 95, specifically in Fortran 2018 [@reid2018new] (and upcoming ones in Fortran 2023), as well as continued development by the Fortran Standards committee. All of this provides a clear incentive to develop further libraries and frameworks focused on providing machine learning capabilities to the Fortran community.



While existing Fortran-based libraries, such as neural-fortran (@curcic2019parallel), address many aspects of neural networks, `ATHENA` provides implementation of some well-known features not currently available within other libraries; these features include batchnormalisation, regularisation layers (such as dropout and dropblock), and average pooling layers.
Additionally, the library provides support for 1, 2, and 3D input data for most features currently implemented; this includes 1, 2, and 3D data for convolutional layers.
Finally, more features convolutional techiques are supported in the `ATHENA` library, including various data padding types, and stride.

Notably, discussions with a spectrum of stakeholders have significantly influenced the development of `ATHENA`, placing paramount importance on accessibility and usability.
This user-centric approach ensures that `ATHENA` is not just a library but a tool that seamlessly integrates with the evolving needs of the neural network community.
One of the primary intended applications of `ATHENA` is in materials science, which heavily utilises convolutional and graph neural networks for learning based on charge densities and atomic structures.
Given the unique data structure of atomic configurations, specifically their graph-based nature, a specialised API must be developed to accommodate these needs.


# Features

A full list of features available within the `ATHENA` library, including available layer types, optimisers, activation functions, and initialisers, can be found on the repository's wiki.

`ATHENA` is developed to handle the following network layer types: batch normalisation (1, 2, and 3D; @ioffe2015batch), convolution (1, 2, and 3D), Dropout [@srivastava2014dropout], DropBlock (2D and 3D; @ghiasi2018dropblock), flatten, fully-connected (dense), pooling (2D and 3D; average and maximum).

The library can handle feed-forward networks with an arbirtray number of hidden layers and neurons (or filter sizes). There exist several activation functions, including Gaussian, linear, sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, tangent hyberbolic functions, and more. Optimiser functions include stochastic gradient decent (SGD), RMSprop, Adam, and AdaGrad. Network models can be saved to and loaded from files.

# Ongoing research projects

The `ATHENA` library is being used in ongoing materials science research, with a focus on structural and materials property prediction.
