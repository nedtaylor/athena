## [1.2.0] - 2023-12-18

### Added

- Add inference to dropout layers
- Add 2D and 3D batch normalisation layers
- Add 1D and 4D flatten layers
- Add predict procedure to network_type
- Add network reset procedure
- Add Adam optimiser

- Convert optimiser to parent and derived types
- Change optimise procedure to minimise
- Handle network learning in network, rather than individual layers
- Rename test/ to example/
- network_tyep%forward now handles assumed rank
- input_layer_type%set now handles assumed rank
